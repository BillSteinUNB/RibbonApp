## Medium Priority: Add Support and Marketing URLs

### Location
app.json - no support URL or marketing URL configured

### Problem
App Store Connect requires Privacy Policy URL, Support URL, and Marketing URL. Currently only local files exist.

### Fix Required
1. Host privacy policy on live HTTPS URL
2. Create support page or email (support@ribbonapp.com)
3. Create marketing website or landing page URL
4. Add URLs to app.json iOS and Android sections

### Required URLs for Submission
- Privacy Policy URL (required)
- Support URL (required)  
- Marketing URL (required - can be same as privacy URL)

### Risk
MEDIUM - BLOCKS submission without URLs configured
